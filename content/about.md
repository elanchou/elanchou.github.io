- Working on Hawk - a crypto trading system that uses fancy ML models to make trading decisions
- HODLing Bitcoin ðŸš€
- Learning about the latest in AI and blockchain

### Tech I Use

- React, SwiftUI, TypeScript for frontend magic
- Go & Python for backend heavy lifting
- PyTorch for ML experiments
- All things Web3 and blockchain
